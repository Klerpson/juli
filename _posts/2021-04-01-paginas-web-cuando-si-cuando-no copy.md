hi guys my name is Sharath so today we are going to see how to host a simple
00:05
website on GitHub
00:08
that's for free. So GitHub is a, is not meant for hosting websites GitHub is
00:13
actually a platform where you can manage your code so let's say you have a single
00:20
you know single project which has some code on it and there are like four or five
00:26
people working on it so it's very hard to manage the code when it's been edited
00:31
by many people so it's really hard to manage if you're doing it on your
00:37
own but GitHub provides a very good solution for that and you will learn
00:42
that you know when you will go deep into GitHub but for now that's not necessary
00:47
so we're just you know we're just going to see the basics so GitHub has an
00:51
option to host your website's that's called GitHub Pages so what I'm going to
00:56
do is I'm going to create a simple website inside GitHub and host it and
01:03
i'll show you and it takes like in just two minutes so we don't need a you
01:09
know Command Line or anything for that you don't even need IDE for coding, you
01:16
can just do that online and lets get started so all you need is a GitHub account.
01:26
i hope you have one otherwise you can sign up and get a free account i'm gonna
01:33
sign in
01:34
I, I already have an account called redgadget. I'm gonna sign into that
01:39
ok so this is what you're going to get, when you sign in so here it's
01:46
showing that what other repositories i have the repositories are nothing but you know
01:49
the folders, kind of folders you have created inside or you can call them
01:54
projects so this is one of the projects which is a blog that i have. So for this
02:03
video i'm going to create a new repository i'm going to name a test and
02:13
i'm going to initialize that with the README file that's not necessary you can
02:19
you know and can always start with a blank repository but I just prefer having a
02:26
README file. Okay let's create. So inside redgadget you know it has created a
02:34
test repository and as you can see doesn't have any, i haven't given any
02:42
description or website. i can give that and it has a single branch that is master
02:47
and test and it has a single file that is README.md. Okay doesn't have
02:58
anything so let's let's create a website so this plus sign is what we use for
03:03
creating websites or adding a file so let's add a file, let's add index.html
03:15
03:19
so once you've done that you have to commit only when you create you know only when
03:32
you commit, the file will be added. So I have committed. So now you can see that
03:41
index.html is there inside me depository. Let's open that, it's blank
03:48
let's add some code in it. Let's add HTML... Hm.. what just happened, okay
03:58
Edit.
04:04
tag
04:08
let's have a title tag, so this is not the way i prefer coding. I usually
04:16
code on Brackets. You can do it on sublime or notepad++ whichever is
04:22
you know is your favorite IDE but for now we're doing it here so let's have a
04:28
title as "first website" and let's create i'll have just a
04:43
this is my first github page. Hm.. that.. that's it
04:56
I think that's enough. So I haven't mentioned any DOCTYPE or HTML5 or
05:02
anything you can mention that but I don't think that's necessary
05:05
let's add some styling here. I prefer adding CSS file in a separate file
05:15
and linking it but you can, for this example I'm doing it here. .body {}
05:25
let's give it a nice background color background
05:32
color green. Green is this not a good color(for background) but that's fine let's change the
05:42
font color as well. Let's make it
05:46
pure wait let's aline it. It will be on the left, so let's align it
05:54
to the center
05:58
you don't have to do all this you know the styling and everything. So once you are
06:03
done changing the file you have to commit again
06:06
ok so now it looks like a proper HTML file. So the thing with HTML
06:13
you know Github Pages is if you wanna host it, you need to have a branch called
06:20
gh, gh stands for pages gh-pages I don't know why they have named it so
06:28
the github pages that makes sense so i have created a new branch and our
06:35
code is in the branch now. Now go to settings. So here in the settings the
06:44
name the default branch you come down the features and here Github Pages. So it
06:53
is saying that your site is ready to be published at this web address. So let's
06:59
see if that is published already, it seems like it has we have it so this is
07:05
the web page so you can make any changes, it looks good you can make any changes
07:10
you want you can add in all JavaScript files can have a CSS files if you have a
07:16
whole project file you can upload that as well, so i will teach you how to do
07:23
that i mean how to upload files if you have a lot of them it's hard to you know
07:30
code here on the github itself.So you you code it on your favorite of IDE, you
07:37
make a project and upload it to the Github and
07:41
this URL looks ugly right so you can have a custom URL as well that is
07:48
also very easy in Github Pages i will teach you that as well. I have created a
07:54
website I've created a lot, i'll show you one which I've hosted on Github
08:02
so this is the one, so this is my personal page actually
08:05
so if you can see the webpage has, obviously has some CSS, has some
08:12
JavaScript going on and some nice effects and these are my projects and
08:22
contact so this is a simple website that Ihave hosted here so you can also
08:29
make some you know
08:30
cool websites where you can host on it(Github) and good luck using Github see you in the
08:36
next one Bye Bye.
